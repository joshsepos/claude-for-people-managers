# Meeting Prep Workflow

Prepare for stakeholder meetings (not 1:1s with direct reports - use [1:1 Prep](1-1-prep.md) for those).

## The Problem

Stakeholder meetings require different preparation than 1:1s:
- You need to know their agenda, not just yours
- The relationship is peer or upward, not direct report
- Context may span multiple projects or initiatives
- You may meet less frequently, requiring more catch-up

## The Solution

Prepare for stakeholder meetings with balanced context:
1. Identify who you're meeting with and their role
2. Gather history from past meetings
3. Surface your agenda items (what you need from them)
4. Anticipate their likely agenda (what they need from you)
5. Identify shared interests and potential friction points

## Required Context

| Context | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| Stakeholder roster | Who they are, their role, your relationship |
| Meeting history | Past meeting notes with this person |
| Project overlap | What you collaborate on |
| Task system | Open items involving them |

## Stakeholder Categories

Different stakeholders need different prep:

| Category | Focus |
|----------|-------|
| Skip-level (your manager's manager) | Visibility, escalations, career |
| Peer managers | Coordination, shared resources, handoffs |
| Cross-functional partners | Dependencies, alignment, collaboration |
| External partners/vendors | Deliverables, contracts, relationship health |

## Inputs

- **Attendees**: Who you're meeting with
- **Topic** (optional): If there's a specific agenda
- **Meeting type** (optional): Recurring sync, one-off, escalation, etc.

## Outputs

- Background on attendee(s) and your history
- Your agenda items (what you need to raise)
- Likely topics from their side
- Recent shared context (projects, decisions, open items)
- Suggested talking points
