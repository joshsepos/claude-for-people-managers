# CLAUDE.md Example: AOR Schedule

Add this section to define your focus areas by day of week.

```markdown
## AOR Days (Weekly Focus Areas)

| Day | Focus Area | Task Project |
|-----|------------|--------------|
| Monday | People Management | Management |
| Tuesday | Project Alpha | Alpha |
| Wednesday | External/Partners | Partners |
| Thursday | Project Beta | Beta |
| Friday | Admin/Flex | General |

When scheduling tasks, align with these focus days:
- People tasks (1:1 prep, feedback, hiring) → Monday
- Alpha work → Tuesday
- Partner meetings, external coordination → Wednesday
- Beta development → Thursday
- Catch-up, planning, admin → Friday

### Exceptions
- Hard deadlines override AOR alignment
- Urgent items stay where they are
- "Agentic Workflows" tasks are flexible (any day)
```

## Why This Helps

- **Weekly Planning**: Claude can auto-move tasks to the right day
- **Scheduling**: When you create tasks, Claude suggests appropriate days
- **Focus**: Reduces context switching by batching similar work

## Customization Ideas

Some managers prefer:
- **Half-day splits**: Morning = meetings, afternoon = focus work
- **Rotating focus**: Different priorities each week
- **Theme weeks**: Entire weeks dedicated to specific initiatives

Adapt the structure to match how you actually work.
