# Ron Harifiyati - MCRI Intern Interview

**Date:** January 2025
**Interviewers:** Josh Sepos, Rob Potvin, Jonathan Yuresko
**Coordinator:** Kelly Watkins Conrad
**Program:** MCRI (Mother Cabrini Readiness Institute)

---

## Candidate Overview

Ron has been at MCRI for approximately one year and demonstrates exceptional maturity in his approach to software development. His interview responses frequently impressed the interviewers with wisdom typically seen in senior developers.

---

## Technical Background

**Languages:** ~4 programming languages currently, plans to learn 4 more in 2-3 years
**Focus Areas:** Swift, SwiftUI (frontend), API development (backend)
**Tools:** GitHub, Jira
**Future Interest:** Cybersecurity, AI threat defense

### Notable Projects

**API Backend (December)**
First backend experience after primarily focusing on Swift/SwiftUI frontend work. Approached it as a learning opportunity that enabled his current role as backend developer on a new project.

**Sign Language App (SOTI Project)**
Group project with a 2-week MVP deadline. When senior team members left for internships mid-project, Ron and one colleague completed the MVP as a 2-person team in the remaining week. Required understanding inherited code and building on top of it under pressure. Learned sign language (taught at MCRI on Mon/Wed/Fri) which helped with development.

**8-Month Personal Project**
A challenging project stuck at API-frontend integration (Month 6). Describes it as his "favorite project because it's the most challenging." Demonstrates persistence on difficult problems.

## Interview Highlights

### Handling Blockers (Standout Response)
When asked about hitting project blockers, Ron shared his philosophy: rather than staying stuck, he steps away to work on other projects to build skills that can help solve the original problem later.

**Josh's reaction:** "The advice you just described is the same advice that our most senior team members who've been developers for a really long time gave."

**Jonathan's reaction:** "We could have used you last night at 8 o'clock when one of my peers was having the same crisis."

### Async/Multi-Timezone Work
Views it as advantageous: "Work never stops. If I'm up and I'm working, by the time I go to sleep, someone else is already up and continuing that work." When blocked and teammates are asleep, focuses on different tasks until help is available.

### Conflict Resolution
During a hackathon under 24-hour pressure, handled team conflicts by recognizing: "The clash isn't being caused because one person's ideas are better... it's mainly because of perspective." Advocates for open mindset, willingness to listen, and potentially merging ideas rather than competing.

### Career Goals (2-3 Years)
- Learn 4 more programming languages
- Move from language mastery to architecture design
- Explore cybersecurity, particularly AI-based threats
- Wants to "protect both myself and the company I'm working for from such threats"

### Learning Philosophy
Wants breadth of knowledge across different fields and roles to better understand and support colleagues: "I want to understand how people in different roles do their work. That way... I don't just bash them out for not being able to complete it, but I understand where they're coming from."

### AI Usage (Notably Restrained)
Follows facilitator advice to not rely on AI. Uses it only when truly stuck with no one available to help. When using AI, prompts it to explain concepts first rather than just providing solutions: "I try prompting it to explain concepts and help me try to understand how this problem erupted."

## Strengths

- **Exceptional maturity** - Wisdom in problem-solving typically seen in senior engineers
- **Resilience** - Handles pressure and setbacks constructively
- **Growth mindset** - Sees challenges as opportunities
- **Self-aware AI usage** - Deliberately limits dependency on AI tools
- **Empathetic leadership** - Values understanding others' perspectives
- **Ambitious yet realistic** - Clear goals with practical plans to achieve them
- **Team player** - Delivered MVP with reduced team under pressure

---

## Areas for Growth

- Could benefit from deeper architecture experience (self-identified goal)
- Cybersecurity interest could be channeled into specific learning path
- Currently focused on individual growth - opportunity to develop mentoring skills

---

## Overall Assessment

Ron stood out significantly in this interview. Multiple times, his responses drew explicit praise from experienced interviewers for matching advice typically given by senior engineers. His approach to handling blockers, team conflict, and AI usage all demonstrated maturity beyond his experience level.

His completion of the SOTI Sign Language app MVP with a 2-person team (down from 6) in one week shows he can deliver under pressure. His long-term thinking about cybersecurity and AI threats shows strategic awareness of the industry.

**Recommendation:** Highly recommended. Ron's maturity, work ethic, and learning approach would make him a strong addition to any team. He appears ready for meaningful responsibility.
