My focus areas by day:

My 1:1s this week (if applicable):

Please:

1. **Check Alignment** - Are tasks scheduled on days that match their focus area? Flag any misaligned tasks with suggested moves.

2. **Identify Overload** - Any day with too many tasks? Suggest what to defer.

3. **1:1 Prep Tasks** - Do I have prep tasks for each upcoming 1:1? If not, suggest adding them the day before.

4. **Deadlines** - Highlight any hard deadlines this week.

5. **Generate Week View** - Show me a clean day-by-day breakdown:
   - Day and focus area
   - Tasks for that day
   - Any flags (overload, missing prep, etc.)

Keep the output actionable - I want to know what to move and what to watch for.
