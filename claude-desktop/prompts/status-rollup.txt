I need a status summary for [PROJECT/PARTNER NAME].

Here's the recent context I have:
[PASTE RECENT MEETING NOTES, UPDATES, OR DOCUMENTS]

Depth needed: [CHOOSE ONE]
- Quick: Just blockers and current phase (30-second summary)
- Standard: Blockers, recent activity, next steps (meeting prep)
- Detailed: Full report with people, docs, timeline

Please generate a status summary with:

1. **Blockers/Risks FIRST** - What's in the way? What might go wrong?

2. **Current State** - Phase, priority, last activity

3. **Recent Activity** - What's happened lately (from the context I provided)

4. **Next Steps** - What needs to happen next

5. **Open Items** (if detailed) - Tasks or decisions pending

Put blockers first - I want to lead with issues, not bury them.
