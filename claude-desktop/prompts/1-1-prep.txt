I have a 1:1 coming up with [NAME]. Help me prepare.

Here are my notes from our last few 1:1s:
[PASTE LAST 1-2 1:1 NOTES HERE]

Please create a prep brief with:

1. **What I Owe Them** (FIRST) - Action items I committed to. Did I complete them?

2. **What They Owe** - Action items they committed to. Items to follow up on.

3. **Parked Topics** - Things we said we'd discuss "next time"

4. **Their Current State** - Based on the notes:
   - Current workload/capacity
   - Active projects
   - Recent wins or blockers

5. **Flags** (if any) - Patterns, overdue items, development areas to weave in

Keep the format clean and scannable. I'll reference this during our meeting.
