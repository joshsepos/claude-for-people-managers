## Overview

Multiple conversations throughout December 2025 about the SADP (Strategic Alliance Developer Program) intern hiring and expectations, including timeline concerns, realistic capacity, and program ownership.

---

## Realistic Expectations (Dec 2)

### The Core Problem
- "Not much is going to get accomplished in three to six months"
- Enormous scope: number of partners × integrations per partner
- Required: stakeholder meetings, partner conversations, mutual customer calls
- Intern onboarding to each solution, learning domain language

### Capacity Reality Check

| Expectation | Reality |
|-------------|---------|
| "20 integrations in 6 months" | Absolutely not possible |
| "3 integrations in 3 months" | Achievable (1 per intern) |
| "App a week" machine | Not what interns are |

**Quote:** "These interns are not an outsourced machine that builds and pushes apps one a week."

### Timeline Breakdown
Even for one integration:
- 2-3 weeks: Onboarding
- 1-2 weeks: Get NFRs sorted out
- 3-4 days: Learn the partner software
- **Result**: Month and a half before coding starts

### Recommended Starting Projects

**Good for interns (existing code, 70%+ done):**
1. SentinelOne to Jamf Protect integration (TICE one, not App Resilience)
2. Splunk integration update
3. Third similar integration (feet wet, learn patterns)

**NOT for interns:**
- App Resilience - "that's a script, less than 100 lines, dumb simple"
- ClickUp or DECS - requires research to define requirements
- Co-pilot thing - needs assessment if non-product team can do it

**Quote:** "If you're expecting 20 in six months, absolutely not."

### Resource Gap

Current state:
- Josh + Rob = part-time on top of other part-time gigs + core job
- Three green interns learning on the fly

Need:
- "True partnerships and integrations team"
- Direct communication with development teams
- Full-time focus, not part-time add-on

### Low Hanging Fruit Flag

Proposal: If a CE/PS SME can "spit it out in a week" - just do it:
- Regardless of who's asking
- Regardless of customer demand
- If big partner asks and it's simple, just do it
- "If it's that easy to do once, it's that easy to maintain"

## Hiring Timeline (Dec 10)

### Original Plan
- Target: February 1 onboarding
- 4 people total for 2026
- Start with 3, add 4th later in year

### Hiring Process Concerns
- Pool availability issues
- Draft scenario (multiple teams competing for same interns)
- Middleman companies involved

### Decision Points
1. Interview quickly now, avoid draft
2. Select fast, get ahead of competition
3. Pre-onboard: "hint hint, here's things to dig into while waiting"
4. February 1 start → Team goes to India ~Feb 4

### Josh's Leadership Philosophy

On being the "failure stick" holder:
- "If anyone was holding the failure stick, it would be me"
- "I'm the program leader, owner. I was the one who pushed everyone into this"
- "I'm okay with that risk"

On naysaying:
- "I'm not scared of everybody's nay-saying"
- "I consider it all information"
- Things are "just things to work through"

On entrepreneurial spirit:
- "I do have an entrepreneurial spirit and I'm good at it"
- "Throw me the challenge"
- Won't be an entrepreneur (likes corporate paycheck/benefits)

### Training Logistics
- Originally Arson wanted Josh to go to India
- Josh proposed virtual training for strategy portion
- Technical training more valuable in-person
- ZScaler meeting scheduled for January

---

## Security Concern Flagged (Dec 16)

### TIKE Backdoor Issue

**CRITICAL finding discovered:**
- Jamf sales has always claimed: "Jamf doesn't have a backdoor to your portals"
- "We can't see your data"
- Josh discovered: "Literally any Jamf [employee] can and I just found a way to"

**Status:** Brought to InfoSec
**Impact:** "Real bad if what I found exists across the board"

## Program Structure Summary

### Current Reality
| Role | Focus |
|------|-------|
| Josh | Program owner, strategy, stakeholder management |
| Rob | Part-time technical guidance |
| Katie John | Partner relationships (non-technical) |
| Interns (3) | Build integrations under supervision |

### What's Needed
- Full-time partnerships team
- Direct engineering access
- Clear escalation to product for complex asks
- Defined ownership of maintenance

## Key Decisions Made

1. **Start small** with existing integration updates
2. **Interview fast** to avoid draft scenario
3. **February onboarding** target maintained
4. **Technical training** prioritized for in-person
5. **Security issue** escalated to InfoSec
