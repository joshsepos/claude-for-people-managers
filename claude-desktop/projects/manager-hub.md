## How I Work

### Preferences
- I prefer [bullet points / prose / tables] for summaries
- Action items should clearly note the owner
- Put blockers and risks first in status updates

### Task Management
I use [Things 3 / Todoist / Linear / etc] for task tracking.

When identifying action items:
- Mark mine as "Me" or my name
- Note due dates only if explicitly stated
- Categorize by project/area

## What I Use You For

- Preparing for 1:1s and stakeholder meetings
- Summarizing meeting notes and transcripts
- Weekly planning and task organization
- Status updates and rollups
- Drafting communications

## Format Preferences

When creating documents:
- Use markdown formatting
- Include clear headers and sections
- Keep summaries concise but complete
- Call out action items explicitly
